Well done on using the cat command. You're on the road to becoming a CLI ninja.

To find your next set of instructions you're going to need to go into dir1.

You can do this using the cd command. This is short for 'change directory'.
You can use it by typing the following:

cd dir1

Once you are in dir1 you can use ls to see what is there and use cat to view any README files.
