Welcome to dir2.

Hopefully you did a quick ls before coming here. If not, don't worry, you can do it in a second, and see that there are two more directories here - dir3 and dir4 and two README files as well.

try and cat README2 and then cat README again to get back to these instructions

README2 has some important instructions in it, but trying to cat it might be a bit of a problem, as it contains way too much text and the important information is at the top of the file.

To view just the top portion of a file, we can use the command head.

Try this:

head README2
