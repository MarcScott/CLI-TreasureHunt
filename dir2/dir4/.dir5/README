Did you see all the directories that are listed. That's quite a few, but the next README is going to be hard to find.
The trick to discovering which directory contains the README will be using another tool called du.

du is short for disk usage.

By typing du you will see the list of all files and directories beside how many kilobytes of memory they are taking up. We'll use the -h flag so that the output is in human readable format.

Try it now by typing:

du -h

then cd into the largest directory.
