Well done. To finish off we need to get back home.

You can use the command:

pwd

To Print Working Directory and see where you are. We're along way from home!

In Linux, your home folder is given a special symbol of its own called a tilde (~)

To get back to your home folder you just need to type

cd ~

And remember - "There's no place like ~"
