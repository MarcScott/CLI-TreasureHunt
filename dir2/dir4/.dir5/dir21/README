The directory listed her (dir31) contains a mess of other directories. Trying to find the README would be a nightmare.

We can search for files and directories using the Linux CLI quite easily though, using the find command.

It can have many different flags, but we'll just use the -name flag for now. cd into dir31 and try

find -name 'README'

It will tell you the directory it's in, which you can then cd into.
