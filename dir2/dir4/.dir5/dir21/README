It's time to go home.
If you type:

pwd

The command Prints your Working Directory.
It would be a little anoying to have to cd .. all the way back to your home folder, but luckily there is a shortcut on Linux

The ~ character represents home, so whenever you want to cd back into your home folder you can type:

cd ~

That's it - just remember the secret phrase "There's no place like home"
