Did you have a look in this directory using ls?

If you did then you will have only seen this README, but there is actually another file and a directory in here, which you couldn't see.

The file and directory are hidden. Hiding files and directories is easy in Linux, you just name the file with a dot at the beginning - .README for example or .dir5.

To list all files and folders in a directory, including the hidden ones, we need to add a flag our ls command.
The flag we use is -a
Try typing this

ls -a

and then cat the file you find
